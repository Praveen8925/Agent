## Overview

The Agent project provides a modular framework for building and deploying AI automation workflows. It enables users to define, schedule, and execute tasks such as data ingestion, model inference, and notifications.

## Features

- Task orchestration with dependency management
- Extensible plugin system for custom actions
- Integration with popular AI frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Scheduling and retry policies
- Logging and monitoring support

## Architecture

The system is composed of the following components:

1. Core Engine: Manages task execution and dependencies.
2. Plugin Manager: Loads and executes custom action plugins.
3. Scheduler: Handles job scheduling and retries.
4. CLI Interface: Provides commands for project initialization, task management, and monitoring.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

agent:
  name: sample_workflow
  schedule: "0 * * * *"
steps:
  - name: fetch_data
    type: HttpRequestAction
    params:
      url: "https://api.example.com/data"
  - name: process_data
    type: DataProcessingAction
    depends_on: fetch_data
```

## Examples
