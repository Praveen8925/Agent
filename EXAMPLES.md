## Tips and Best Practices

### Research Agent Optimization

#### Input Formulation
- **Be Specific:** Instead of "AI", use "AI applications in financial fraud detection"
- **Include Context:** "Latest developments in quantum computing for drug discovery"
- **Set Scope:** "Small business digital marketing trends in 2024"

#### Getting Better Results
- Start with broad topics, then narrow down
- Ask follow-up questions for deeper analysis
- Combine multiple research sessions for comprehensive coverage

### Website Development Optimization

#### Project Description Best Practices

**Good Examples:**
```
✅ "Create a modern bakery website with online ordering, menu display, location info, and customer reviews"
✅ "Build a portfolio site for a photographer specializing in weddings, with gallery, packages, and booking system"
✅ "Develop a fitness trainer website with class schedules, membership plans, and progress tracking"
```

**Avoid These:**
```
❌ "Make a website" (too vague)
❌ "Build something cool" (no specific requirements)
❌ "Create a site like Facebook" (too complex)
```

#### Optimal Project Scope
- **Small Projects (5-10 minutes):** Landing pages, portfolios, simple business sites
- **Medium Projects (10-20 minutes):** E-commerce, multi-page business sites, service platforms
- **Large Projects (20+ minutes):** Complex applications, multiple integrations, advanced features

### Performance Considerations

#### API Usage Optimization
- Start with simple projects to test setup
- Use descriptive but concise project descriptions
- Monitor your Google API usage and quotas

#### Quality Optimization
- Provide clear, specific requirements
- Include target audience information
- Mention specific features you need
- Specify design preferences (modern, minimal, colorful, etc.)
